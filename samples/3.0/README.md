# Samples for EMG XML 3.0
This folder contains several samples of documents matching the EMG XML 3.0 schema. Each file is authored so that it validates correctly against the [EMG XML 3.0 schema](../../schema/3.0/xml-import.xsd).

The following files contain samples that are not meant to represent a real-life sample. On the other hand they are used to show the different parts of the schema and how they can be correctly used.
* [provider-sample.xml](./provider-sample.xml)
* [location-sample.xml](./location-sample.xml)
* [course-sample.xml](./course-sample.xml)
* [event-sample.xml](./event-sample.xml)
